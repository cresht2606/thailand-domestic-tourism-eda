### üáπüá≠ ‚úàÔ∏è Thailand Domestic Tourism (2019-2023): Preparatory Data Science & EDA üèùÔ∏è üåä ###
#### From Raw Data To Analytic Insights: Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Preparation For Future Modeling ####


This dataset reveals the total revenue, number of tourists and accommodation expenses with percentage and numerical means of Thailand tourism divided into geographical provinces (North, South, East, Central, East Northeast) across the year 2019 - 2023. All of credits go to the author Thaweewat R on Kaggle and Official Ministry of Tourism and Sports Statistics of Thailand for raw data.

### Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Seaborn), Plotly, Scikit-learn. 

### Minor Improvements From Previous Simulated E-commerce EDA:
- Engaging storytelling data explanation, visual aids
- Integration of formal research-writing tone
- Partially neat programming style, flexible transformer - scaling - encoding feature pipelines 
- Separated versions for different training model sets (Time Series, Regression / Classification)
- All-in-one savestate of each theme-based graphs

### Possible enhancements in final version:
- Comprehensive theme-based interpretation with references
- OutlierStripping function: Export outliers dataset
- Continual refinement of visual aids, particularly emojis
- Deducted grammatic flaws, awkward vocabulary uses
